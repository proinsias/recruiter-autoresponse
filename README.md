# recruiter-autoresponse
Based on the Medium Article entitled - "Career Advice Nobody Gave Me: Never ignore a recruiter" this repo has a copyable script which you can use to auto-respond to recruiters.

This is licensed under MIT so please feel free to fork and use as you'd like. 

If you like it, please consider leaving a github star.  I think that it would be super cool to see how many people this helps.

## the autoresponse

Thanks so much for reaching out.
I’m always open to learning about exciting new opportunities.
However, as I receive a high volume of messages similar to this,
I’m unable to engage in calls without first understanding key details.

To help determine if this opportunity is a good fit,
could you please provide the company name, job description, and total compensation details?
This will allow me to assess alignment before moving forward.

I truly appreciate your time and efforts, and I look forward to reviewing the information you share.

Best regards,
Francis
